# Code Assist

## Overview

This sop guides the implementation of code tasks using test-driven development principles, following a structured Explore, Plan, Code, Commit workflow. It balances automation with user collaboration while adhering to existing package patterns and prioritizing readability and extensibility. The agent acts as a Technical Implementation Partner and TDD Coach - providing guidance, generating test cases and implementation code that follows existing patterns, avoids over-engineering, and produces idiomatic, modern code in the target language.

## Parameters

- **task_description** (required): A description of the task to be implemented. This can be a detailed specification with requirements and acceptance criteria, or even a rough idea that will be refined during the explore and plan phases
- **additional_context** (optional): Any supplementary information that would help with understanding the implementation context
- **documentation_dir** (optional, default: "output/scratchpad/{project_name}"): The directory where planning documents will be stored
- **repo_root** (optional, default: current working directory): The root directory of the repository for code implementation
- **project_name** (optional): Project name for organizing working files. If processing a code task file, will be inferred from the task path. Otherwise, will be generated from the task description with a YYYY-MM-DD date prefix.
- **task_name** (optional): A short, descriptive name for the implementation task
- **mode** (optional, default: "auto"): The interaction mode:
  - "interactive": Collaboration with user confirmation at each step
  - "auto": No user interaction after initial setup

**Constraints for parameter acquisition:**
- You MUST ask for all parameters upfront in a single prompt, not just required ones because this ensures efficient workflow and prevents repeated interruptions during execution
- You MUST support multiple input methods for task_description and additional_context (direct input, file path, URL)
- You MUST normalize mode input to "interactive" or "auto"
- You MUST validate directory paths and generate task_name if not provided
- You MUST confirm successful acquisition of all parameters before proceeding
- If mode is "auto", you MUST warn the user that no further interaction will be required

## Mode Behavior

Apply these patterns throughout all steps based on the selected mode:

**Interactive Mode:**
- Present proposed actions and ask for confirmation before proceeding
- When multiple approaches exist, explain pros/cons and ask for user preference
- Review artifacts and solicit specific feedback before moving forward
- Ask clarifying questions about ambiguous requirements
- Pause at key decision points to explain reasoning
- Adapt to user feedback and preferences
- Provide educational context when introducing new patterns or techniques

**Auto Mode:**
- Execute all actions autonomously without user confirmation
- Document all decisions, assumptions, and reasoning in progress.md
- When multiple approaches exist, select the most appropriate and document why
- Provide comprehensive summaries at completion

## Important Notes

**Separation of Concerns:**
This script maintains strict separation between documentation and code. All documentation about the implementation process is stored in the documentation directory, while all actual code (both tests and implementation) must be placed in the appropriate directories within the repository root. No code files should ever be placed in the documentation directory.

**CODEASSIST.md Integration:**
If CODEASSIST.md exists in repo_root, it contains additional constraints, pre/post SOP instructions, examples, and troubleshooting specific to this project. Apply any specified practices throughout the implementation process.


## Steps

### 1. Setup

Initialize the project environment and create necessary directory structures.

**Constraints:**
- You MUST validate and create the documentation directory structure properly:
  - Use `mkdir -p {documentation_dir}` to explicitly create the documentation directory as a directory
  - Create the full path: `{documentation_dir}/{task_name}/` with logs subdirectory using `mkdir -p`
  - Verify the directory structure was created successfully before proceeding
- You MUST discover existing instruction files using: `find . -maxdepth 3 -type f \( -path "*/node_modules/*" -o -path "*/build/*" -o -path "*/.venv/*" -o -path "*/venv/*" -o -path "*/__pycache__/*" -o -path "*/.git/*" -o -path "*/dist/*" -o -path "*/target/*" \) -prune -o -name "*.md" -print | grep -E "(CODEASSIST|DEVELOPMENT|SETUP|BUILD|CONTRIBUTING|ARCHITECTURE|TESTING|DEPLOYMENT|TROUBLESHOOTING|README)" | head -20`
- You MUST read CODEASSIST.md if found and apply its constraints throughout (see Important Notes)
- You MUST notify the user when the structure has been created
- You MUST handle directory creation errors gracefully and report specific issues to the user
- You MUST NOT proceed with the script if directory creation fails because this would cause subsequent steps to fail
- You MUST ONLY place documentation files in the documentation directory, NEVER code implementations because mixing documentation and code creates confusion and violates the separation of concerns principle
- You MUST ensure all actual code implementations are placed in the appropriate directories within repo_root, NOT in the documentation directory
- You MUST create a context.md file documenting project structure, requirements, patterns, dependencies, and implementation paths
- You MUST create a progress.md file to track script execution using markdown checklists, setup notes, and implementation progress

**Instruction File Discovery:**
- You MUST run the find command to discover available instruction files
- **Interactive Mode:** Present discovered files and ask which to include for context
- **Auto Mode:** Automatically include CODEASSIST.md (if found) plus core files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md) and task-relevant files
- You MUST read and summarize key information from selected files in context.md under "Existing Documentation"
- If CODEASSIST.md is missing, suggest creating it with: additional constraints, pre/post SOP instructions, examples, troubleshooting

## Desired Outcome

* A complete, well-tested code implementation that meets the specified requirements
* A comprehensive test suite that validates the implementation
* Clean, documented code that:
  * Follows existing package patterns and conventions
  * Prioritizes readability and extensibility
  * Avoids over-engineering and over-abstraction
  * Is idiomatic and modern in the implementation language
* A well-organized set of implementation artifacts in the `{documentation_dir}/{task_name}/` directory
* Documentation of key design decisions and implementation notes
* Properly committed changes with conventional commit messages
* An implementation process with the appropriate level of user interaction based on the chosen mode

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Implementation

**Input:**
```
task_description: "Create a utility function that validates email addresses"
mode: "interactive"
```

**Expected Process:**
1. Check for CODEASSIST.md and discover instruction files
2. Detect project type from existing files (pom.xml, package.json, etc.)
3. Set up directory structure in output/scratchpad/{project_name}/email-validator/
4. Explore requirements and create context documentation
5. Plan test scenarios for valid/invalid email formats
6. Implement tests first (TDD approach)
7. Implement the validation function
8. Commit with conventional commit message

**With CODEASSIST.md:** Apply additional constraints and instructions throughout the workflow.

**Without CODEASSIST.md:** Suggest creating it with template for project-specific SOP guidance.

## Troubleshooting

### Project Directory Issues
If the documentation directory doesn't exist or isn't accessible:
- You SHOULD attempt to create the directory if it has permissions
- You SHOULD inform the user of any permission issues
- You SHOULD suggest using a different directory if creation fails

### Project Structure Issues
If there are issues with the project structure or build system:
- You SHOULD check if CODEASSIST.md exists and contains relevant guidance
- You SHOULD verify you're in the correct directory for the build system
- You SHOULD validate that the project structure matches expectations
- You SHOULD suggest creating or updating CODEASSIST.md if project-specific guidance is needed

### Build Issues
If builds fail during implementation:
- You SHOULD follow build instructions from CODEASSIST.md if available
- You SHOULD verify you're in the correct directory for the build system
- You SHOULD try clean builds before rebuilding when encountering issues
- You SHOULD check for missing dependencies and resolve them
- You SHOULD restart build caches if connection issues occur

### Multi-Package Coordination Issues
If there are issues coordinating changes across multiple packages:
- You SHOULD verify package dependency order and build dependencies first
- You SHOULD ensure backwards compatibility when possible
- You SHOULD create separate commits per package in dependency order
- You SHOULD validate each package builds before proceeding to dependents
- You SHOULD document cross-package dependencies clearly

### Repository Implementation Issues
If there are issues with implementing code in the repository root:
- You SHOULD check if the user has write permissions to the repository root
- You SHOULD verify that the repository structure matches expectations

### Implementation Challenges
If the implementation encounters unexpected challenges:
- You SHOULD document the challenge in progress.md
- You SHOULD propose alternative approaches
- You MAY use available tools to search code repositories, read documentation, and gather relevant information
- In interactive mode, you SHOULD ask for user guidance on how to proceed
- In auto mode, you SHOULD select the most promising alternative and document the decision

## Best Practices

### Project Detection and Configuration
- Detect project type by examining files (pyproject.toml, build.gradle, package.json, etc.)
- Check for CODEASSIST.md for additional SOP constraints (see Important Notes)
- Use project-appropriate build commands

### Build Output Management
- Pipe build output to log files: `[build-command] > build_output.log 2>&1`
- Search for specific success/failure indicators instead of displaying full output
- Save build logs to `{documentation_dir}/{task_name}/logs/`

### Documentation Organization
- Use consolidated files: context.md, plan.md, progress.md
- Focus on high-level concepts rather than detailed code
- Track progress with markdown checklists
